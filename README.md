# PostREST
Ultra-compact REST API for PostgreSQL, built on PHP

I created this project, as an experimental, minimalist REST API, built using PHP7, atop of PostgreSQL.  

The goal was to created the most light-weight yet flexible implementation, that can be used as a starting point to build a more robust application.
